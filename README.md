# Group 3 Project 3: Venture

## Overview:
As a group, we have collectively developed an application to help promote social outdoor activities. With this application you can "Venture" around seeking activities to do with your families and/or friends. furthermore if everyone around you happens to be busy, you can always use the buddy systems and meet new people who are also wanting to connect and Venture with you. This application provides full profile customization and interests, as well as assistance on preparing plans with our scheduling section. Venture also has a built-in dynamic map that specifies the weather to help you plan for your upcoming activities.
